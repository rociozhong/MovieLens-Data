# MovieLens-Data

For this project, I use MovieLens 100K Dataset (http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ 100k/). The data set consists of 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. Each user has rated at least 20 movies. The main data set, 'u.data', includes variables: user id, item id, rating and timestamp. And it has been split into five pairs of training and testing data sets (denoted by 'u1.base', 'u1.test',..., 'u5.base', 'u5.test'). The user information data includes the number of users, item id, and individual rating for a specific item. The user information dataset has demographical factors such as age, gender, occupation and zip code. The item information data consists of movie id, title. release date, and its genres.

The goal of this project is to predict preferences scores or ratings of each user. Given many missing values, we first try Matrix Factorization method to estimate the predictions. Then we tend to explore whether the missing ratings does occur at random. If not, we need to build a recommender system with a high accuracy of prediction, which demonstrate that the predictive performance can be enhanced based on informative missing values.
